Why does updating event not sync cosanctions?!?!?!

Add number of nights for stall in event "Nights for stall" -default 0

Can you add "Entry information coming soon" to Light Em Up Page

On the "People who have signed up" it is showing multiple co-sanctions of the same one??

The correct times of the race aren't coming up correctly on the description on the race.
    -->put in 11 am race start and it shows up as 12 am??



Light em up
    -->refactor css and adjust removeAttribute accordingly
