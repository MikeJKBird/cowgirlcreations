layout for event page


Need to get divison checkboxes, that will be passed along
-admin should be able to create divisions (open, youth, senior, etc)
-these will appear as checkboxes on create event page
-when user enters race, they will select the boxes, which will be passed to the enrollment object
-backend math can count how many and multiply by race cost accordingly
-do different divisions cost different prices?


User should be able to sign up twice with a new horse
    -->event page and profile should show which horse they've already signed up with


Need to start adding math
    -->add total cost field to enrollment
    -->select camping/stall/etc adds fee to total
        -->all costs are on event object, will need to use event_id from enrollment object to find these
        values (can search only if they are selected to reduce db hits).
        -->need to have a cumulative total cost

    -->refamiliarize yourself with payment logic
