Entries
    -->enrollment object will add all of these price values together and to the total cost (behind the scenes math)
    -->should show user on event page which entries they have

Potential sign up issues
    -->display running total? -needs javascript

Need to display events on a calendar

Need to make adding points to users after a race easier
    -->list of users who signed up would be easier, but need to add users who might not sign up online
    -->have points multiplier displayed
    -->participation gets added for every participant
-->one strategy, list all enrolled users, and put 1,2,3 representing the position they finished. Backend math the correct score to add to existing
    -->problem, people in multiple entries? Can just input one entry at a time?

Need to start adding math
    -->add total cost field to enrollment
    -->select camping/stall/etc adds fee to total
        -->all costs are on event object, will need to use event_id from enrollment object to find these
        values (can search only if they are selected to reduce db hits).
        -->need to have a cumulative total cost
    -->refamiliarize yourself with payment logic
