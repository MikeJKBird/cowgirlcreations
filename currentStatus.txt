When click on add event, it makes an event object
    -->needs to redirect to add entries page


Entries
        -->if enough time, make a selectable list of previous used names
    -->enrollment object will add all of these price values together and to the total cost (behind the scenes math)
    -->should show user on event page which entries they have

Potential sign up issues
    -->display running total? -needs javascript

Need to display events on a calendar


Need to start adding math
    -->add total cost field to enrollment
    -->select camping/stall/etc adds fee to total
        -->all costs are on event object, will need to use event_id from enrollment object to find these
        values (can search only if they are selected to reduce db hits).
        -->need to have a cumulative total cost
    -->refamiliarize yourself with payment logic
