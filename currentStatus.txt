When users sign up for events, need to add extra information to event/user relationship (ex. camping fee, stall fee, etc)
-->How can horse selection be passed along?
    -->add information that can change to event/user schema
    -->Add checkbox to form for each piece of data that user can add on
    -->Checkboxes work for multiple divisions, but what about for different horses?

On admin event details, need to display horse with enrollment
    -->feels like a gross hack to get the user to display, try to get info from the enrollment, so the horse can be displayed through the same loop


add caption to photo
resize photo
    -->possibly create thumbnail as well

layout for event page

create profile page
    -->need to have user add information before being able to sign up for race (horse, etc)
    -->option data can be input on profile


Implement Auth
    -->admin and normal user


Have this list done by next meeting: Approx April 7th
