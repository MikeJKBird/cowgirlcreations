When users sign up for events, need to add extra information to event/user relationship (ex. camping fee, stall fee, etc)
-->How can horse selection be passed along?
    -->add information that can change to event/user schema
    -->Add checkbox to form for each piece of data that user can add on
    -->Checkboxes work for multiple divisions, but what about for different horses?
** What if a normal pivot table was replaced with an Enrollment model? Where it had the pivot info plus more? Then can treat like an
object instead of just a mapping. Yes, do this. Smart! Make the relationship 1 event->many enrollments and 1 user->many enrollments

On edit user page, adding a new horse needs a new horse to be created and then assigned to user.
