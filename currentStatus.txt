Entries
        -->if enough time, make a selectable list of previous used names
    -->when user is signing up for event, all entries will be listed with a corresponding checkbox
    -->when checkbox is selected, it will add enrollment_id to the entry
    -->enrollment object will add all of these price values together and to the total cost (behind the scenes math)

Potential sign up issues
    -->adding entry will cause page to refresh, but save info, or require before adding other stuff
    -->should display running total, should be easy since page reloads


Sponsors method on admin controller should move to sponsorscontroller

Need to start adding math
    -->add total cost field to enrollment
    -->select camping/stall/etc adds fee to total
        -->all costs are on event object, will need to use event_id from enrollment object to find these
        values (can search only if they are selected to reduce db hits).
        -->need to have a cumulative total cost
    -->refamiliarize yourself with payment logic
